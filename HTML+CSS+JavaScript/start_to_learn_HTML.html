<h2>What is Coding?</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="_blank" title="Computer programming wikipedia">Computer programming </a> is <strong>the process of performing</strong> a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by <u>designing and building</u> an executable computer program.
<p>Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p>
